# 7drl2013

This was a set of tests for a space based roguelike made during *7 Day Roguelike* game competition back in 2013. It's mostly just tests for star system generation and navigation. Some of the examples likely don't work anymore, I may do a quick patch.

Live demo is http://thegup.com/7drl2013/public/index.html . The other html pages also are there to play with
